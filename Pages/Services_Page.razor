    <p class="lead mb-4">
        We are committed to making your shopping experience smooth from start to finish.
        Below we describe the services we provide in detail — from how quickly we ship orders,
        to how we protect your purchase and support you after delivery.
    </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Fast &amp; Secure Delivery</h5>
        <p>
            We prioritize speed and predictability in delivery so you receive your purchases when you expect them.
            Orders are processed as soon as payment is confirmed; in major cities we aim for same-day or next-day dispatch
            depending on the product and availability. Cutoff times for same-day dispatch are shown at checkout. For every
            shipment we choose appropriate carriers based on reliability and transit time to your location. We also provide
            estimated delivery windows during checkout and send timely notifications so you always know the expected arrival.
        </p>

        <h5>Reliable Delivery &amp; Address Validation</h5>
        <p>
            Reliability means your order arrives on time and at the right place. To make this possible we validate shipping
            addresses during checkout, provide clear instructions for special delivery requests, and select courier partners
            with strong track records. If an address looks incomplete we prompt for correction before fulfillment. For
            remote or difficult-to-access locations we offer delivery alternatives such as scheduled delivery slots or
            pickup points. When exceptions occur (weather, carrier delays), we proactively notify customers with next steps.
        </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Safe Packaging &amp; Eco Options</h5>
        <p>
            Every product is packaged according to category-specific guidelines to minimize damage in transit. Fragile items
            receive cushioning and secure inner packaging; electronics are packed to prevent static and impact damage.
            We balance protection with sustainability: boxes are the right size to avoid excessive void space and we offer
            recyclable or low-plastic packaging options where possible. Every parcel is checked before seal to ensure the
            right item, accessories, and documentation are included.
        </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Real-time Tracking &amp; Notifications</h5>
        <p>
            Transparency is essential — after dispatch you receive a tracking number and a direct link to follow your parcel.
            We provide milestone updates (dispatched, in transit, out for delivery, delivered) via email and SMS, and show
            the current status in your account. If delivery attempts fail, you are informed immediately with options to
            reschedule or redirect the shipment. For delivered packages we include proof-of-delivery details when available.
        </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Easy Returns &amp; Refunds</h5>
        <p>
            We make returns straightforward so you can shop with confidence. If an item is eligible for return, our return
            policy explains the timeframe, condition requirements, and refund process. Returns can be initiated from your
            order history, where you will find pre-filled details and step-by-step instructions. Once the returned item is
            received and inspected, refunds are processed promptly to the original payment method or as store credit, per your
            preference.
        </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Warranty &amp; Repair Support</h5>
        <p>
            Many products include manufacturer or seller warranties. On the product page and in the order confirmation we
            clearly state warranty coverage and claim procedures. If you face a defect or malfunction, our support team will
            guide you through troubleshooting, submitting a warranty claim, or arranging repair/replacement. For non-warranty
            support, we provide repair guidance and recommended service centers where applicable.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
        <h5>Secure Payments &amp; Payment Options</h5>
        <p>
            We offer multiple secure payment methods so you can choose what suits you best. We accept major debit and credit
            cards, UPI, net banking and other local gateways. All payments are processed via trusted, PCI-compliant providers;
            sensitive payment information is never stored on our servers. At checkout you will also see options for EMI or
            cash-on-delivery when available for specific products or regions.
        </p>

        <h5>Customer Support &amp; Assistance</h5>
        <p>
            Our customer support team is dedicated to resolving issues quickly and politely. Support channels include email,
            in-site chat, and phone during business hours. We provide order updates, pre-sale advice, and post-sale assistance
            including returns, refunds, warranty claims, and technical help. For complex issues we escalate internally and
            keep you informed until the case is resolved.
